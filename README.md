# ETL-Project
This project contains CSV's containing GDP data by county, and the Corruption Perception Index of a country. The aim of this ETL project is to determine whether a country's GDP has an impact on how corrupt a country is. The assumption is that countries with lower GDP will be prone to corruption, since their government is not equipped to take care of their needs. Conversely, countries with higher GDP will have more wealth distribution so their infrastructure is well-funded to address the needs of their citizens. 

Once the databases and tables are created, join statements can be made on country code, GDP by year, and their CPI index score. Higher scores will coincide with higher levels of GDP. Lower amounts of GDP will result lower CPI scores.
